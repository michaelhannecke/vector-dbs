## Introduction

In the era of AI applications, vector databases have become crucial infrastructure components for storing and querying high-dimensional data. Containerization offers numerous advantages for vector database deployments, including:

- **Isolation**: Run your vector database in a controlled environment without dependency conflicts
- **Portability**: Deploy the same configuration across development, testing, and production
- **Scalability**: Easily scale with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes
- **Reproducibility**: Share configurations through Docker files for consistent environments
- **Resource management**: Allocate specific CPU and memory resources to optimize performance

This guide provides ready-to-use Docker configurations for the top 5 open source vector databases: Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate, Chroma, and FAISS (with a custom API).

## Vector Databases Included

This repository includes Docker configurations for:

1. **Milvus**: Production-ready vector database with high scalability
2. **Qdrant**: Vector search engine with powerful filtering capabilities
3. **Weaviate**: Semantic vector database with ML-first architecture
4. **Chroma**: Lightweight and developer-friendly vector database
5. **FAISS**: Efficient similarity search library (with a custom API wrapper)

## Getting Started

Each database has its own directory with all necessary configuration files. Follow the README in each directory for specific instructions.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- At least 8GB RAM available (16GB recommended for running multiple databases)
- Git

### Quick Start

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vector-db-docker.git
cd vector-db-docker
```

To run a specific database (e.g., Milvus):

```bash
cd milvus
docker-compose up -d
```

## Directory Structure

- `/milvus`: Milvus Docker configuration
- `/qdrant`: Qdrant Docker configuration
- `/weaviate`: Weaviate Docker configuration
- `/chroma`: Chroma Docker configuration
- `/faiss-api`: FAISS with a custom API wrapper
- `/examples`: Example Python scripts to interact with each containerized database
- `/monitoring`: Prometheus and Grafana configurations for monitoring


## Configuration Options

Each database's Docker Compose file includes common configuration options:

- Volume mounts for data persistence
- Port mappings
- Environment variables for customization
- Memory/CPU constraints
- Health checks

## Monitoring Setup

The `/monitoring` directory contains a Docker Compose file for deploying Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your vector databases. 

## Production Considerations

For production deployments, consider:

1. Using Kubernetes for container orchestration
2. Implementing proper authentication mechanisms
3. Setting up TLS for secure connections
4. Configuring backups and disaster recovery
5. Tuning resource allocations based on workload
